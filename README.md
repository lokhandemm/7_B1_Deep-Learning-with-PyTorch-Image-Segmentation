  # 🧠 Image Segmentation using PyTorch:       
                        
  
## 📌 Overview

**Image Segmentation** is a computer vision technique that partitions a digital image into multiple segments (groups of pixels), making it easier to analyze and extract meaningful information. This project focuses on implementing image segmentation using **PyTorch** and the **U-Net architecture**, a powerful model for pixel-level classification.

## 🔧 Model: U-Net

**U-Net** is a convolutional neural network architecture known for its encoder-decoder structure with skip connections. It efficiently captures context and enables precise localization by combining low-level spatial features with high-level semantic information.

### 🔁 Highlights: 
- Symmetrical architecture
- Skip connections to reduce information loss
- High performance on biomedical and general segmentation tasks
